# Lapser
```
Laura needed a timelaps generator thingy so I made one.
```
Converts a list of images into a video, you can also add the timestamp of each picture.

## Basic
You can find a base configuration in the `cfg.py` file but you can also set stuff using args

[X] --resize: change origin img size ex: --resize 1920x1080
[X] --delta-timestamp: fix timestamps (camera time is wrong) ex: --delta-timestamp -10
[X] --timestamp: add timestamp to the video
[] Add click
[] Add custom font?
[] --timestamp-pos: define position of the timestamp
[] --sound-path add sound
[] --fade: adds fade in/fade out
[] Create lapser class

[] Create a dockerfile so Laura can use it "out of the box"
